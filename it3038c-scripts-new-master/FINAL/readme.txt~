Run this after you find your music files using the scraper found here:
https://github.com/carlthome/audio-scraper

NOTE: MY SCRIPT WAS ONLY TESTED TO WORK ON CENTOS 64 BIT AND 64BIT ARCH LINUX
My script will sort your files into a folder of just mp3s and other music files.
I recommend running this in the same directory as the audio scraper's results.
